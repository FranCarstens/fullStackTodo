#[Check'd - Todo List](https://check-d.herokuapp.com)

Everything is a todo list, so is *Check'd*. What makes Check'd better? For one, it's easy on the eyes.

Built on the Maestro full stack starter kit. Check'd was built using HMTL5, Sass, Javascript, React with Flux, Backbone, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB.

Check'd started as a weekend assignment for *The Iron Yard*.
